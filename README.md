In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Domino's Pizza's business processes, focusing on order processing and delivery performance. Leveraging data 
analytics and NoSQL databases, we explored various aspects of Domino's operations, including customer feedback analysis, delivery tracking, and menu optimization.

Through the implementation of a star schema and the utilization of analytical rules, we provided insights into delivery performance trends, customer preferences, and 
operational efficiencies. Our analysis revealed actionable recommendations for Domino's to enhance customer satisfaction, improve delivery times, and maintain 
competitiveness in the fast-food industry.

By harnessing data-driven insights from unstructured and semi-structured data sources, Domino's Pizza can optimize its operations, tailor its menu offerings, and 
deliver exceptional service to customers worldwide.
